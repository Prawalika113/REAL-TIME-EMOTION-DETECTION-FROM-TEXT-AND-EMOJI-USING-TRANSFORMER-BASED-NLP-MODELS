Understanding human emotions embedded in textual content has become increasingly vital in various real-world applications ranging from customer experience management to psychological analysis. This project presents a robust emotion detection framework designed to identify and classify diverse emotional expressions such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, love, and surprise from textual data. By leveraging the power of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the system aims to decode emotional nuances with high accuracy and contextual awareness.

The proposed methodology begins with data acquisition and preprocessing, including techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, and stop-word removal to refine textual input. Feature extraction methods like TF-IDF and word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) are employed to capture semantic and syntactic properties of the text. Subsequently, a range of machine learning algorithms—including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and deep learning models such as LSTM—are explored to train the emotion classification model.Performance evaluation is conducted using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score across multiple emotion classes. The framework is tested on benchmark emotion-labeled datasets spanning various domains and languages to ensure generalizability and robustness.

This study highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning and NLP in understanding human emotions from unstructured text. The developed system holds significant potential for applications in social media monitoring, mental health analysis, customer feedback systems, and intelligent human-computer interaction.
